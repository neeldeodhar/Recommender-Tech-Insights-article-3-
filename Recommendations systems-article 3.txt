In this article, the author talks about 4 machine learning trends towards the recommendation systems:

1) Use of content and collaborative filtering:
	For this trend, the author explains differences between content filtering and collaborative filtering:
    
       "Content based filtering works from baseline of an existing user profile.....collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on similar users, or activity around similar groups....".
       For example an algorithm using content based filtering might recommend similar color or size to the user; whereas the one using collaborative might recommend relevant items to the user.

2)  Shift from statistical modeling to deep learning-based modelling:
         
           According to the author the biggest reason for shift to deep learning based modelling is performance (...which generate more accurate correlations and subsequent predictions for business task....".
             a) Better representation of underlying model, algorithm.
             b) better evaluations.
             c) better optimizations.
           lastly ...."deep neural networks are able to scale effectively with large datasets"....

3) Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM)

   The model allows users to benchmark:
     a) "The speed at which the model performs"
     b) "how various numerical techniques affect network accuracy"

    grabbing the system and creating peformance matrix out of it.

4) Improving recommendation performance with Neural Magic:
        Neural Magic is redefining machine learning performance on a CPU"

    According to the author clients/programmers are faced with 3 tradeoffs to achieve results:
         1) reduce model size
         2) Reduce batch size
         3) reduce accuracy
    and according to the author, Neural Magic addresses these challenges by reducing the amount of computation, "accelerating memory bound processes and running larger models with larger inputs to improve accuracy".
